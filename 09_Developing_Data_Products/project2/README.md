# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 3 Peer-graded Assignment: Plotly

In this project, we created a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly, representing the number of road accidents in Great Britain from 2005 to 2015, grouped by severity (slight, serious, or fatal).

The presentation is [published online on RPubs](https://github.com/radduri/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/09_Developing_Data_Products/project2).

The source data sets are not included in this repository. To reproduce this presentation, you will need to download the zipped [Road Safety Data - Accidents 2017](http://data.dft.gov.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/road-accidents-safety-data/dftRoadSafetyData_Accidents_2017.zip).
